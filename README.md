## Project description
This project explores the prediction of loan default status using a machine learning classification approach. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The goal is to accurately classify whether a loan applicant is likely to default, leveraging real-world financial data and evaluating model performance through metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix. The project provides insights into important predictive features and demonstrates a practical workflow for tackling binary classification problems in the financial domain.
